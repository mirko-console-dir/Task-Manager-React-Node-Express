a web-based application that allows you to manage your tasks efficiently. This project showcases my skills and knowledge in front-end and back-end web development using ReactJS, Node.js with Express.js, and database integration with MongoDB.

## Features

- Task management: Create, update, and delete tasks to keep track of your work.
- Task filtering and sorting: Filter tasks by status (completed/incomplete).
- User-friendly UI: The interface is responsive and designed to provide a smooth user experience.
- Database storage: All task data is securely stored in a MongoDB database.
